# stopwatch-javascript
hello everyone!
    This is just a simple example of a stopwatch project using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.....

This code will create a simple stopwatch with three buttons: Start, Stop, and Reset.....
    When the Start button is clicked, the stopwatch will start running.
    When the Stop button is clicked, the stopwatch will stop running.
    When the Reset button is clicked, the stopwatch will be reset to zero.
 
The stopwatch will display the time in hours, minutes, seconds.
The time is formatted using the stopwatch() function.
